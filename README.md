# HEADSTART

We‚Äôre looking to nudge web2 creators over to the open and decentralized economy. Mirroring their existing web2 content and deploying it via token bound accounts (ERC-6551), their creations are minted as NFTs within the token bound account and other people can collect the posts. The funds will be accumulated into the account and when the original creator is ready, they RECLAIM their ownership and we‚Äôll transfer the ERC-6551 to their new SAFE account abstraction wallet. 

1. We‚Äôll mirror the content from popular inspiration and portfolio sites.

2. Deploy a token bound account for each of the creators with a lens handle and thereafter the creations as posts.

3. The posts generate tips from the community via collects. The funds are stored in the respective token bound account.

4. The creators can go in and claim their profile, validate using their source account and we‚Äôll initiate a transfer to the real owner to their new SAFE account abstraction wallet.

_We‚Äôre all looking for cool ways to onboard ‚ú®the next billion users‚ú®_

# Sponsor & Bounties

### Polygon
ü§ù¬†Deployed to Mumbai and Polygon powering a core part of the Headstart ecosystem, Lens Protocol. Utilizing SAFE{Core} Account Abstraction SDk we used SAFE Account Abstraction for creating what we believe could be a future onboarding mechanism. By incentivizing creators with content they already created they can already start reaping the benefits of accumulating followers and collecting (funds). But to naturally onboard them to transfer the ownership of the Token Bound Account ERC-6651 we utilize Web3Auth social login and in the background a fully functioning SAFE wallet.

### The Graph
**New Headstart Subgraph:**

Headstart Subgraph indexes each content creator profile. The profile entity features the tokenbound account address, its owner, token identifier, the Lens handle that it owns and the Lens profile identifier associated to that handle. 

The profile entity is as follow :
```
type Profile @entity {
  id: String!
  accountAddress: Bytes!
  ownedBy: Bytes! 
  tokenId: BigInt!
  handle: String! 
  blockNumber: BigInt!
  blockTimestamp: BigInt!
  transactionHash: Bytes!
  profileId: BigInt!
}
```

### ApeCoin DAO
Using the ERC-6551 and SAFE Account Abstraction Wallet we believe this has true potential to benefit the community, properly incentivizing more people to join the ecosystem and put even more great content onchain!

### NOUNS
We kept the Nounish vibes, Headstart ‚åê‚ó®-‚ó® looking at creating a new onboarding mechanism utilizing the latest tech and exploring the realm of possibilities.
